# --- Network ACL Configuration --- #
# This configuration defines the Network ACLs (NACLs) for controlling traffic in public and private subnets.
#
# Public NACL:
# - Allows inbound traffic for web services (HTTP on port 80 and HTTPS on port 443).
# - Allows all outbound traffic to simplify egress rules.
#
# Private NACL:
# - Allows inbound traffic for MySQL (port 3306) within the VPC.
# - Allows all outbound traffic to simplify egress rules.
# - Restricts all other traffic to enhance security in private subnets, as per default NACL behavior.
#
# Each NACL is associated with the appropriate public or private subnets within the VPC.
